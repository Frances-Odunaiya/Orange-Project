        <h2>Exploring the Many Species of Oranges</h2>
        <img src="images/orange-fruit.jpg" alt="Orange Fruit">
        <p>One of the unique joys of growing up in an orchard was learning the diversity of orange species. From the tangy blood oranges to the sweet mandarins, every type had its own character and use. My father would explain the subtle differences in taste, texture, and even aroma. These distinctions helped us experiment with countless <strong>Oranges Orchard Recipes</strong>, each recipe designed to highlight the best qualities of the fruit—whether that meant a tart marmalade, a refreshing juice, or a sweet candied peel.</p>

        <h2>How Can We Turn Oranges into Delicious Drinks and Snacks?</h2>
        <img src="images/two-orange-fruits.jpg" alt="Two Orange Fruits">
        <p>Juice was the centerpiece of our daily life, but it never ended there. My father and I experimented with smoothies, combining oranges with berries, bananas, and sometimes even vegetables for a unique twist. These drinks were both healthy and refreshing, perfect for hot afternoons after a long day of work. Beyond drinks, our <strong>Oranges Orchard Recipes</strong> also included snacks like candied orange peels and baked treats infused with zest. It was our way of honoring every part of the fruit—nothing went to waste.</p>

      <!-- Card 3: Creative Uses -->
      <div class="card" id="uses">
        <h2>Creative Uses Beyond the Fruit</h2>
        <img src="images/pile-of-oranges.jpg" alt="Pile of Oranges">
        <p>What made our orchard truly special was the belief that oranges had more to offer than just the flesh. My father showed me how the peels could be dried and used in teas, or grated for zest in cakes and breads. Even the oil from the peel became a natural fragrance at home. These small but meaningful touches made our <strong>Oranges Orchard Recipes</strong> more than food—they became a lifestyle, a way of appreciating nature’s gifts fully and responsibly.</p>

      <h3>About the Author</h3>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Charis Doe</strong>, and my lifelong connection to oranges began in my father’s orchard, 
        where I learned firsthand the art of cultivating and savoring fresh citrus. Those childhood experiences— 
        harvesting fruit, learning family recipes, and understanding the value of natural ingredients—shaped both 
        my passion and my expertise. Today, as the founder of <em>Oranges Orchard Recipes</em>, I bring that same 
        knowledge and creativity into every recipe I share. My goal is to provide readers with trustworthy, tested 
        recipes that celebrate tradition while inspiring fresh ideas, so you can enjoy the richness of citrus just 
        as my family has for generations.
